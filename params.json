{"name":"Squire","tagline":"tending to all your resquirements","body":"### Welcome to Squire.\r\nsquire /ˈskwī(ə)r/ – a young nobleman acting as an attendant to a knight before becoming a knight himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nSquire is a Chrome extension that makes it super easy to enable / create voice commands for various browser tasks. In addition, to the many built-in commands Squire offers, users can also define their own voice commands that can be bound to multiple user-defined actions.\r\n\r\n### Goal\r\nWe created Squire with the goal of offering accessibility and convenience to users through customizable voice commands, an intuitive UI, and useful functionality.\r\n\r\n### Inspiration\r\nWe all felt that the browser needed some type of approachable \"shell\" to help reduce the amount of navigation for simple tasks. Furthermore, we felt like if polished, Squire can help improve many disabled users' experience while browsing the Internet.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n| Command       | Action                   | Example            |\r\n| ------------- |:------------------------:| --------------:|\r\n| `open <arg>`        | opens url          | `open abc.xyz` |\r\n| `close tab`       | closes current tab               | `close`|\r\n| `close all`       | closes all tabs               | `close all`|\r\n| `close <arg.com>`       | closes \\*://\\*.arg.com/\\*               | `close google.com`|\r\n| `new`         | opens new tab          | `new`        |\r\n| `say`         | speech to speech         | `say hello world` |\r\n| `search`      | searches google           | `search big cats`  |\r\n| `read`        | text to speech selection | `read`         |\r\n| `copy`        | copies selection           | `copy`         |\r\n| `cut`         | cuts selection            | `cut`          |\r\n| `paste`       | pastes selection          | `paste`        |\r\n| `amazon`      | searches amazon           | `amazon toys`  |\r\n| `reddit`      | searches reddit           | `reddit cats`  |\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nDerek Hua (@derekhua), Jesse Chau (@JChauster), and Xin He (@xin-he).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
